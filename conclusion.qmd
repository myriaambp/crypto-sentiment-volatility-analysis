# Conclusion

This exploratory analysis examined whether online sentiment and search interest reveal meaningful patterns in Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. The main takeaway is that behavioral signals move alongside prices and volatility but do not reliably lead them—sentiment and search interest reflect market mood rather than predict it. Among the two signals, sentiment shows a modest connection to next day returns for Ethereum, while search interest provides almost no useful signal for either coin. A consistent finding across all analyses is that Ethereum responds more strongly to behavioral indicators than Bitcoin does, likely because its market is smaller and more sensitive to shifts in attention and attitudes.

Several limitations constrain these findings. The dataset spans only one year due to free tier API restrictions, which may not capture longer term patterns or rare market regimes. Sentiment and search data required imputation for roughly 8% of days, and while the gaps appeared unrelated to price behavior, any imputation introduces uncertainty. The analysis is purely descriptive; no causal claims can be made about whether sentiment influences prices or simply reacts to them. Future work could extend the time window using paid data access, incorporate additional cryptocurrencies to test whether Ethereum's heightened sensitivity generalizes to other altcoins, or apply time series modeling to more rigorously test lead lag relationships. The main lesson learned is that behavioral data in crypto markets is noisy and reactive—useful for understanding market mood in real time, but unlikely to offer a simple edge for anticipating what comes next.
