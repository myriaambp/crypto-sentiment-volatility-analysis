# Introduction

This project examines how behavioral factors such as sentiment and attention shape cryptocurrency market dynamics between October 2024 and October 2025, focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Motivated by my background in neuroscience and my interest in transitioning to finance, I am particularly drawn to understanding how patterns of human behavior manifest in financial data. Cryptocurrencies provide an ideal setting for this research because their prices are highly sensitive to collective mood and information flow, often reacting to changes in public sentiment and online search activity quite rapidly. The analysis centers on three questions: How daily sentiment fluctuations, whether optimistic or pessimistic, correlate with market volatility and returns, whether spikes in public attention, measured through Google search interest, precede or follow periods of heightened instability, and whether Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in how strongly they respond to these behavioral signals. Through these questions, the project aims to understand how behavioral and psychological dynamics influence financial market movements.
