    "title": "Behavioral Signals in Crypto: Analyzing Sentiment and Search Trends as Predictors of Market Volatility",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project examines how behavioral factors such as sentiment and attention shape cryptocurrency market dynamics between October 2024 and October 2025, focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Motivated by my background in neuroscience and my interest in transitioning to finance, I am particularly drawn to understanding how patterns of human behavior manifest in financial data. Cryptocurrencies provide an ideal setting for this research because their prices are highly sensitive to collective mood and information flow, often reacting to changes in public sentiment and online search activity quite rapidly. The analysis centers on three questions: How daily sentiment fluctuations, whether optimistic or pessimistic, correlate with market volatility and returns, whether spikes in public attention, measured through Google search interest, precede or follow periods of heightened instability, and whether Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in how strongly they respond to these behavioral signals. Through these questions, the project aims to understand how behavioral and psychological dynamics influence financial market movements.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis project integrates three open data sources to examine how market activity, online sentiment, and public attention evolve for Bitcoin and Ethereum between December 2, 2024 and December 1, 2025. This one year window corresponds to the maximum period available under the free tiers of the APIs used in this project: both CoinGecko and Santiment restrict historical access to approximately the past 365 days unless a paid plan is used.\nDaily market data come from the CoinGecko Market Data API, which compiles cryptocurrency prices, trading volumes, and market capitalization across major global exchanges. Online sentiment is obtained from the Santiment API, which analyzes social media discussions and other text based signals to estimate the overall tone toward each asset. Public attention is measured using Google Trends, accessed through the gtrendsR package in R, which provides normalized daily search interest for the keywords “bitcoin” and “ethereum.”\nAPI requests require authentication, so all keys were stored privately in my .Renviron file. The data pull script automatically downloads the raw JSON responses, converts them into CSV files, and stores them in data/raw/. These raw files are then cleaned, standardized, and merged by coin and date. This includes aligning timestamps to a daily frequency, normalizing sentiment values, and handling a small number of missing days, primarily dates where Santiment did not report sentiment data, which is common due to API rate limits or gaps in social media coverage.\nThe final merged dataset contains one full year of daily observations for each coin and provides a reproducible foundation for exploring how market conditions, sentiment, and search behavior relate to cryptocurrency volatility.\nAll data collection and preprocessing steps are contained in 1 Data Pull.qmd, which downloads data from all three APIs, saves raw files to data/raw/, and writes the cleaned, merged dataset to data/clean/merged_crypto_sentiment_trends.csv.",

Sentiment Score has the highest proportion of missing values, close to 8.5 % for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Search Interest and 7 Day Volatility follow with smaller gaps of about 1.6 and 1.9 %. Daily Return has roughly 0.3 % missingness, which corresponds to the initial day of each series when no previous price exists. The core market variables Coin, Date, Price, Volume, and Market Cap are fully observed across the entire year. Bitcoin and Ethereum display almost identical missingness patterns, which indicates that the gaps come from shared upstream sources rather than asset specific issues.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Missingness Over Time\nUnderstanding how missingness evolves over time provides insight into whether gaps are random or structured. The analysis next focuses on the four variables with missing values to identify the timing and potential causes of these gaps.\n\n\nCode\nvars_with_missing &lt;- c(\n  \"sentiment_score\",\n  \"search_interest\",\n  \"volatility_7d\",\n  \"daily_return\"\n)\n\ndf_long &lt;- df |&gt;\n  select(date, coin, all_of(vars_with_missing)) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = all_of(vars_with_missing),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    missing = is.na(value),\n    variable = recode(variable,\n      sentiment_score = \"Sentiment Score\",\n      search_interest = \"Search Interest\",\n      volatility_7d   = \"7-Day Volatility\",\n      daily_return    = \"Daily Return\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(missing)\n\nggplot(df_long, aes(x = date, y = variable)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#e6550d\", size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, ncol = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Variable\",\n    title = \"Missingness Over Time by Variable\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissingness occurs in well defined locations rather than at random. Sentiment Score and Search Interest share identical missing dates late in the year for both coins, which points to temporary gaps in the external data sources rather than issues with the market data itself. Daily Return is missing only on the first available date, where it cannot be computed, and 7-Day Volatility is missing during the first six days of each series due to the rolling window requirement.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Price Behavior on Missing vs. Non-Missing Days\nSince the gaps for sentiment score and search interest originate from upstream data limitations, the next step is to determine whether imputation is appropriate. Given that the dataset covers only one year for each asset, retaining as many observations as possible is valuable. However, imputation should only be applied if missingness is unrelated to unusual market conditions. For this reason, I examine whether missingness in the externally sourced variables aligns with abnormal price behavior before deciding how to proceed.\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(sent_missing = if_else(is.na(sentiment_score), \"Missing\", \"Present\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = sent_missing, y = price)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#3182bd\", alpha = 0.45, color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, ncol = 2, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(x = \"Sentiment Score Status\", y = \"Price\") +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 14)\n\np2 &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(search_missing = if_else(is.na(search_interest), \"Missing\", \"Present\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = search_missing, y = price)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#3182bd\", alpha = 0.45, color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, ncol = 2, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(x = \"Search Interest Status\", y = \"Price\") +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 14)\n\np1 / p2 + \n  plot_annotation(title = \"Price Levels on Days With and Without Missing Values\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment Score: Price levels look similar on days with and without missing sentiment, with overlapping medians and interquartile ranges. This suggests that missingness in sentiment does not correspond to unusual market conditions. The gaps likely reflect coverage issues in the sentiment feed rather than price movements.\nSearch Interest: Price distributions again overlap closely, indicating that missing search interest values are not linked to abnormal price behavior. Google Trends often omits low volume days or returns incomplete windows, and the pattern here aligns with those expected limitations.\n\n\n2.2.4 Imputation Strategy\nLinear interpolation is used only for Sentiment Score and Search Interest, since their missing values come from gaps in the external APIs rather than from anything inherent to the data. In contrast, the early missing values in Daily Return and 7-Day Volatility are expected, because these metrics cannot be computed at the start of the series, so those NA values are left in place. This strikes a balance between preserving the meaning of the derived variables and smoothing the two externally sourced features. Because the dataset is fairly small (one year per coin), filling these external gaps also helps avoid unnecessarily losing observations, even though the overall amount of missingness is low.\n\n\nCode\ndf_imputed &lt;- df |&gt;\n  arrange(coin, date) |&gt;\n  group_by(coin) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    sentiment_score_imp = na.approx(sentiment_score, na.rm = FALSE),\n    search_interest_imp = na.approx(search_interest, na.rm = FALSE),\n    daily_return_imp    = daily_return,\n    volatility_7d_imp   = volatility_7d\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\ndf_imputed |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    sentiment_original_NA = sum(is.na(sentiment_score)),\n    sentiment_filled_NA   = sum(is.na(sentiment_score_imp)),\n    search_original_NA    = sum(is.na(search_interest)),\n    search_filled_NA      = sum(is.na(search_interest_imp))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Outlier Detection\nIt is also useful to check for unusually large or extreme observations. Because the variables in this dataset operate on very different scales, some extreme points may not be obvious at first glance. Looking for outliers helps confirm that the data behave as expected during periods of high market activity and ensures that no unexpected spikes are the result of data errors. This step provides an additional check on data quality before moving into the exploratory analysis.\nVariables vary widely in scale, so outlier detection uses standardized Z-scores. This produces a comparable frame of reference and highlights unusually large deviations.\n\n\nCode\ndf_z &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(across(\n    c(price, volume, market_cap,\n      sentiment_score, search_interest,\n      daily_return, volatility_7d),\n    ~ scale(.)[,1],\n    .names = \"{.col}_z\"\n  ))\n\ndf_z |&gt;\n  select(coin, ends_with(\"_z\")) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ends_with(\"_z\"),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"z\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    variable = gsub(\"_z\", \"\", variable),\n    variable = recode(variable,\n      price = \"Price\",\n      volume = \"Volume\",\n      market_cap = \"Market Cap\",\n      sentiment_score = \"Sentiment Score\",\n      search_interest = \"Search Interest\",\n      daily_return = \"Daily Return\",\n      volatility_7d = \"7 Day Volatility\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = coin, y = z, fill = coin)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = \"#e6550d\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 3,  linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -3, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Outlier Detection Using Standardized Z-Scores\",\n    x = \"Coin\",\n    y = \"Z-Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 15) + theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardizing the variables makes it easier to compare their distributions. A few observations fall beyond ±3 standard deviations for Volume, Daily Return, and Seven Day Volatility. These points line up with periods of sharp price swings or heavy trading, which are typical features of cryptocurrency markets. Sentiment and Search Interest show occasional spikes during times of increased public attention. None of these observations indicate problems with data quality, so all values are kept in the dataset.\nThe final cleaned and imputed dataset used in results.qmd is saved in data/clean/.\n\n\nCode\n# Create the final cleaned dataset for exploration\n# Use imputed sentiment and search interest\n# Retain derived metrics as originally computed\n\ndf_final &lt;- df_imputed |&gt;\n  transmute(\n    date,\n    coin,\n    price,\n    volume,\n    market_cap,\n    sentiment_score = sentiment_score_imp,\n    search_interest = search_interest_imp,\n    daily_return    = daily_return_imp,\n    volatility_7d   = volatility_7d_imp\n  )\n\n# Save to clean data folder\nwrite_csv(\n  df_final,\n  here(\"data\", \"clean\", \"crypto_final_clean.csv\")\n)",

This confirms what the earlier analysis suggested: Ethereum experiences larger daily swings in both directions. Its sharper sentiment swings, higher volatility, and stronger response to lagged behavioral signals all trace back to this fundamental difference.

    "text": "3.10 Summary\nThis exploratory analysis examined how sentiment and search interest relate to Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements. Three questions guided the investigation:\nHow do prices, sentiment, and public attention change over time? All three variables move in recognizable cycles. Prices decline early in the year, rally in summer, and pull back in fall. Sentiment and search interest follow these price cycles, rising during rallies and falling during declines.\nHow closely do sentiment and search interest track market volatility? Sentiment becomes more dispersed on high-volatility days, with both strongly positive and strongly negative readings appearing when price moves are large. Search interest also rises during volatile periods but does not show the same dispersion pattern. Sentiment appears more connected to the emotional character of market activity.\nDo Bitcoin and Ethereum respond differently to behavioral signals? Yes. Ethereum consistently shows stronger reactions. It has wider sentiment swings, higher volatility, and a more dispersed return distribution. Previous-day sentiment shows a modest positive relationship with next-day returns for Ethereum but almost none for Bitcoin. Search interest provides weak signals for both coins. These differences suggest that Ethereum’s market is more sensitive to shifts in online attention and attitudes than Bitcoin’s is.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This exploratory analysis examined whether online sentiment and search interest reveal meaningful patterns in Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. The main takeaway is that behavioral signals move alongside prices and volatility but do not reliably lead them—sentiment and search interest reflect market mood rather than predict it. Among the two signals, sentiment shows a modest connection to next day returns for Ethereum, while search interest provides almost no useful signal for either coin. A consistent finding across all analyses is that Ethereum responds more strongly to behavioral indicators than Bitcoin does, likely because its market is smaller and more sensitive to shifts in attention and attitudes.\nSeveral limitations constrain these findings. The dataset spans only one year due to free tier API restrictions, which may not capture longer term patterns or rare market regimes. Sentiment and search data required imputation for roughly 8% of days, and while the gaps appeared unrelated to price behavior, any imputation introduces uncertainty. The analysis is purely descriptive; no causal claims can be made about whether sentiment influences prices or simply reacts to them. Future work could extend the time window using paid data access, incorporate additional cryptocurrencies to test whether Ethereum’s heightened sensitivity generalizes to other altcoins, or apply time series modeling to more rigorously test lead lag relationships. The main lesson learned is that behavioral data in crypto markets is noisy and reactive—useful for understanding market mood in real time, but unlikely to offer a simple edge for anticipating what comes next.",
