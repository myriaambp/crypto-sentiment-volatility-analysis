    "title": "Behavioral Signals in Crypto: Analyzing Sentiment and Search Trends as Predictors of Market Volatility",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project examines how behavioral factors such as sentiment and attention shape cryptocurrency market dynamics between October 2024 and October 2025, focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Motivated by my background in neuroscience and my interest in transitioning to finance, I am particularly drawn to understanding how patterns of human behavior manifest in financial data. Cryptocurrencies provide an ideal setting for this research because their prices are highly sensitive to collective mood and information flow, often reacting to changes in public sentiment and online search activity quite rapidly. The analysis centers on three questions: How daily sentiment fluctuations, whether optimistic or pessimistic, correlate with market volatility and returns, whether spikes in public attention, measured through Google search interest, precede or follow periods of heightened instability, and whether Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in how strongly they respond to these behavioral signals. Through these questions, the project aims to understand how behavioral and psychological dynamics influence financial market movements.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis project integrates three open data sources to examine how market activity, online sentiment, and public attention evolve for Bitcoin and Ethereum between December 2, 2024 and December 1, 2025. This one year window corresponds to the maximum period available under the free tiers of the APIs used in this project: both CoinGecko and Santiment restrict historical access to approximately the past 365 days unless a paid plan is used.\nDaily market data come from the CoinGecko Market Data API, which compiles cryptocurrency prices, trading volumes, and market capitalization across major global exchanges. Online sentiment is obtained from the Santiment API, which analyzes social media discussions and other text based signals to estimate the overall tone toward each asset. Public attention is measured using Google Trends, accessed through the gtrendsR package in R, which provides normalized daily search interest for the keywords “bitcoin” and “ethereum.”\nAPI requests require authentication, so all keys were stored privately in my .Renviron file. The data pull script automatically downloads the raw JSON responses, converts them into CSV files, and stores them in data/raw/. These raw files are then cleaned, standardized, and merged by coin and date. This includes aligning timestamps to a daily frequency, normalizing sentiment values, and handling a small number of missing days, primarily dates where Santiment did not report sentiment data, which is common due to API rate limits or gaps in social media coverage.\nThe final merged dataset contains one full year of daily observations for each coin and provides a reproducible foundation for exploring how market conditions, sentiment, and search behavior relate to cryptocurrency volatility.\nAll data collection and preprocessing steps are contained in 1 Data Pull.qmd, which downloads data from all three APIs, saves raw files to data/raw/, and writes the cleaned, merged dataset to data/clean/merged_crypto_sentiment_trends.csv.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nThe goal of this section is to describe where these gaps occur, whether they follow meaningful patterns, and how they should be handled prior to analysis.\n\n2.2.1 Missingness Summary\n\n\nCode\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\n# Load all libraries silently\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(tidyverse)\n  library(naniar)\n  library(janitor)\n  library(here)\n  library(scales)\n  library(zoo)\n})\n\ndf &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"clean\", \"merged_crypto_sentiment_trends.csv\"), show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf |&gt;\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"missing_count\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(missing_count))\n\n\nTo compare missingness across variables, the plot below shows the percentage of missing values for each variable within each coin.\n\n\nCode\nnice_names &lt;- c(\n  daily_return    = \"Daily Return\",\n  date            = \"Date\",\n  market_cap      = \"Market Cap\",\n  price           = \"Price\",\n  search_interest = \"Search Interest\",\n  sentiment_score = \"Sentiment Score\",\n  volatility_7d   = \"7-Day Volatility\",\n  volume          = \"Volume\",\n  coin            = \"Coin\"\n)\n\nmiss_coin &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~ is.na(.), .names = \"miss_{col}\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(coin) |&gt;\n  summarise(across(starts_with(\"miss_\"), mean)) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"miss_\"),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"missing_prop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    missing_pct = missing_prop * 100,\n    variable = str_remove(variable, \"miss_\"),\n    variable = nice_names[variable]\n  )\n\nggplot(miss_coin, aes(x = fct_reorder(variable, missing_pct), y = missing_pct)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#3182bd\") +\n  facet_grid(\n    rows = vars(coin),\n    scales = \"free_x\",\n    switch = \"x\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Percent Missing\",\n    title = \"Missingness by Coin\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    strip.placement = \"outside\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows that missingness is concentrated in variables that rely on external data sources rather than market feeds. Sentiment Score has the highest proportion of missing values, close to 8.5 % for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Search Interest and 7 Day Volatility follow with smaller gaps of about 1.6 and 1.9 %. Daily Return has roughly 0.5 % missingness, which corresponds to the initial day of each series when no previous price exists. The core market variables Coin, Date, Price, Volume, and Market Cap are fully observed across the entire year. Bitcoin and Ethereum display almost identical missingness patterns, which indicates that the gaps come from shared upstream sources rather than asset specific issues.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Missingness Over Time\nUnderstanding how missingness evolves over time provides insight into whether gaps are random or structured. The analysis next focuses on the four variables with missing values to identify the timing and potential causes of these gaps.\n\n\nCode\nvars_with_missing &lt;- c(\n  \"sentiment_score\",\n  \"search_interest\",\n  \"volatility_7d\",\n  \"daily_return\"\n)\n\ndf_long &lt;- df |&gt;\n  select(date, coin, all_of(vars_with_missing)) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = all_of(vars_with_missing),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    missing = is.na(value),\n    variable = recode(variable,\n      sentiment_score = \"Sentiment Score\",\n      search_interest = \"Search Interest\",\n      volatility_7d   = \"7-Day Volatility\",\n      daily_return    = \"Daily Return\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(missing)\n\nggplot(df_long, aes(x = date, y = variable)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#e6550d\", size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, ncol = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Variable\",\n    title = \"Missingness Over Time by Variable\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissingness occurs in well-defined locations rather than at random. Sentiment Score and Search Interest share identical missing dates late in the year for both coins, which points to temporary gaps in the external data sources rather than issues with the market data itself. Daily Return is missing only on the first available date, where it cannot be computed, and 7-Day Volatility is missing during the first six days of each series due to the rolling-window requirement.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Price Behavior on Missing vs. Non-Missing Days\nSince the gaps for sentiment score and search interest originate from upstream data limitations, the next step is to determine whether imputation is appropriate. Given that the dataset covers only one year for each asset, retaining as many observations as possible is valuable. However, imputation should only be applied if missingness is unrelated to unusual market conditions. For this reason, I examine whether missingness in the externally sourced variables aligns with abnormal price behavior before deciding how to proceed.\n\n\nCode\ndf |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    sent_missing = if_else(is.na(sentiment_score), \"Missing\", \"Present\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = sent_missing, y = price)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#3182bd\", alpha = 0.45, color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, ncol = 2, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sentiment Score Status\",\n    y = \"Price\",\n    title = \"Price Levels on Days With and Without Missing Sentiment\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    search_missing = if_else(is.na(search_interest), \"Missing\", \"Present\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = search_missing, y = price)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#3182bd\", alpha = 0.45, color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, ncol = 2, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Search Interest Status\",\n    y = \"Price\",\n    title = \"Price Levels on Days With and Without Missing Search Interest\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment Score: Price levels look similar on days with and without missing sentiment, with overlapping medians and interquartile ranges. This suggests that missingness in sentiment does not correspond to unusual market conditions. The gaps likely reflect coverage issues in the sentiment feed rather than price movements.\nSearch Interest: Price distributions again overlap closely, indicating that missing search interest values are not linked to abnormal price behavior. Google Trends often omits low-volume days or returns incomplete windows, and the pattern here aligns with those expected limitations.\n\n\n2.2.4 Imputation Strategy\nLinear interpolation is used only for Sentiment Score and Search Interest, since their missing values come from gaps in the external APIs rather than from anything inherent to the data. In contrast, the early missing values in Daily Return and 7-Day Volatility are expected, because these metrics cannot be computed at the start of the series, so those NA values are left in place. This strikes a balance between preserving the meaning of the derived variables and smoothing the two externally sourced features. Because the dataset is fairly small (one year per coin), filling these external gaps also helps avoid unnecessarily losing observations, even though the overall amount of missingness is low.\n\n\nCode\ndf_imputed &lt;- df |&gt;\n  arrange(coin, date) |&gt;\n  group_by(coin) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    sentiment_score_imp = na.approx(sentiment_score, na.rm = FALSE),\n    search_interest_imp = na.approx(search_interest, na.rm = FALSE),\n    daily_return_imp    = daily_return,\n    volatility_7d_imp   = volatility_7d\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\ndf_imputed |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    sentiment_original_NA = sum(is.na(sentiment_score)),\n    sentiment_filled_NA   = sum(is.na(sentiment_score_imp)),\n    search_original_NA    = sum(is.na(search_interest)),\n    search_filled_NA      = sum(is.na(search_interest_imp))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Outlier Detection\nIt is also useful to check for unusually large or extreme observations. Because the variables in this dataset operate on very different scales, some extreme points may not be obvious at first glance. Looking for outliers helps confirm that the data behave as expected during periods of high market activity and ensures that no unexpected spikes are the result of data errors. This step provides an additional check on data quality before moving into the exploratory analysis.\nVariables vary widely in scale, so outlier detection uses standardized Z-scores. This produces a comparable frame of reference and highlights unusually large deviations.\n\n\nCode\ndf_z &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(across(\n    c(price, volume, market_cap,\n      sentiment_score, search_interest,\n      daily_return, volatility_7d),\n    ~ scale(.)[,1],\n    .names = \"{.col}_z\"\n  ))\n\ndf_z |&gt;\n  select(coin, ends_with(\"_z\")) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ends_with(\"_z\"),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"z\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    variable = gsub(\"_z\", \"\", variable),\n    variable = recode(variable,\n      price = \"Price\",\n      volume = \"Volume\",\n      market_cap = \"Market Cap\",\n      sentiment_score = \"Sentiment Score\",\n      search_interest = \"Search Interest\",\n      daily_return = \"Daily Return\",\n      volatility_7d = \"7 Day Volatility\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = coin, y = z, fill = coin)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = \"#e6550d\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 3,  linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -3, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Outlier Detection Using Standardized Z-Scores\",\n    x = \"Coin\",\n    y = \"Z-Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 15) + theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardizing the variables makes it easier to compare their distributions. A few observations fall beyond ±3 standard deviations for Volume, Daily Return, and Seven Day Volatility. These points line up with periods of sharp price swings or heavy trading, which are typical features of cryptocurrency markets. Sentiment and Search Interest show occasional spikes during times of increased public attention. None of these observations indicate problems with data quality, so all values are kept in the dataset.\nThe final cleaned and imputed dataset used in results.qmd is saved in data/clean/.\n\n\nCode\n# Create the final cleaned dataset for exploration\n# Use imputed sentiment and search interest\n# Retain derived metrics as originally computed\n\ndf_final &lt;- df_imputed |&gt;\n  transmute(\n    date,\n    coin,\n    price,\n    volume,\n    market_cap,\n    sentiment_score = sentiment_score_imp,\n    search_interest = search_interest_imp,\n    daily_return    = daily_return_imp,\n    volatility_7d   = volatility_7d_imp\n  )\n\n# Save to clean data folder\nwrite_csv(\n  df_final,\n  here(\"data\", \"clean\", \"crypto_final_clean.csv\")\n)",

Both experience an early-year decline, a strong midsummer recovery, and a late-year pullback. This parallel movement reflects how closely the two markets respond to the same macro forces and shifts in investor sentiment. Bitcoin begins the period near 100 thousand dollars, dips to the low 80 thousands in early spring, then rallies sharply above 120 thousand dollars during the summer. The surge aligns with renewed institutional inflows and optimism surrounding the upcoming 2025 halving. After peaking, it trends downward into the fall as broader risk sentiment cools and flows into crypto ETFs slow.\nEthereum mirrors this pattern but with larger percentage swings. It falls from around 4 thousand to below 2 thousand dollars early in the year amid uncertainty around network upgrades and competition from L2 platforms. It rebounds aggressively in the summer, nearly doubling from its spring lows, before softening again in the fall.\nComparing the two, Ethereum is more volatile, showing deeper drawdowns and more dramatic recoveries, while Bitcoin moves more gradually despite larger absolute price changes.\nBoth assets show clear jumps and dips around mid-summer and late fall. These shifts coincide with changes in Federal Reserve rate expectations, ETF flow cycles, and crypto-specific developments like upgrade announcements and regulatory commentary. Neither coin exhibits long periods of calm, highlighting how sensitive cryptocurrency markets remain to external news and behavioral sentiment.\nSHORTER: Bitcoin and Ethereum move through the year in similar waves. Both fall early in the year, recover strongly in the summer, and pull back again in the fall. Bitcoin shows steadier movements in absolute terms, while Ethereum swings more in percentage terms. Both react quickly to changes in economic news, liquidity conditions, and crypto specific announcements. Neither coin stays stable for long, which highlights how sensitive crypto prices are to investor sentiment and headlines.",

The scale runs from 0 to 100, where 100 represents that coin’s highest search activity during the year and all other values show relative levels compared to that peak.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = search_interest, color = coin)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.9) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"BITCOIN\" = \"#3182bd\", \"ETHEREUM\" = \"#e6550d\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Search Interest\",\n    title = \"Search Interest Over Time for Bitcoin and Ethereum\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch interest for both coins moves in noticeable waves across the year. Peaks appear during periods of fast price changes or major news, with Bitcoin showing strong attention early in the year and again in midsummer and late fall. Ethereum has similar cycles but with sharper bursts tied to ecosystem updates. The scale runs from 0 to 100 and reflects each coin’s highest search volume over the year. A value of 100 marks that coin’s peak interest, and lower values show relative drops from that point. The values are not comparable across coins. Overall, search activity rises when markets are more active or uncertain, matching the patterns seen in price and volatility.",

    "text": "3.6 Do Sentiment and Volatility Move Together?\nTo explore how attitudes relate to actual price swings, we compare daily sentiment scores with the size of daily returns. A scatterplot with a smooth trend helps show whether large swings tend to occur when sentiment is very positive, very negative, or somewhere in between.\nNote: Absolute daily return measures how much the price moved in a single day, regardless of direction. Larger values indicate more volatile trading days, while values near zero show little movement. The sentiment score reflects the tone of online discussions, with positive values indicating optimism, negative values indicating concern, and values near zero showing neutral sentiment.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abs(daily_return), y = sentiment_score, color = coin)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.35) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"BITCOIN\" = \"#3182bd\", \"ETHEREUM\" = \"#e6550d\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Absolute Daily Return\",\n    y = \"Sentiment Score\",\n    title = \"Sentiment and Market Movement\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 64 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 64 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach point in the plot represents one day. The horizontal axis shows the sentiment score for that day, and the vertical axis shows how large the price move was on that same day. Larger values on the vertical axis mean bigger up or down swings in the market. Overall, the plot shows that most days have sentiment close to zero and small price moves. As sentiment becomes more extreme, the range of possible price moves becomes wider. In other words, calm sentiment is usually followed by calmer trading, while more emotional sentiment days are linked with more active price movement. The smooth line helps summarize this pattern. For Bitcoin, the line is almost flat because most of the points cluster in the center. Ethereum has a slight dip at the center and rises at the edges, which reflects that Ethereum tends to have bigger moves on days when sentiment is strongly positive or negative. The main takeaway is that sentiment and market activity are related, but the relationship is not linear. Extreme moods in the market often align with larger price changes, especially for Ethereum.\nBecause the scatterplot suggests that sentiment becomes more dispersed on high movement days, we next group days into four return categories based on the size of their absolute daily price change (very small, small, medium, and large). Visualizing these buckets with violin plots lets us see how the full distribution of sentiment shifts as price moves become larger.\n\n\nCode\ndf_binned &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    return_bin = cut(\n      abs(daily_return),\n      breaks = c(0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, Inf),\n      labels = c(\"Very Small\", \"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"),\n      include.lowest = TRUE\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(return_bin))  # remove NA category\n\nggplot(df_binned, aes(x = return_bin, y = sentiment_score, fill = coin)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.7, trim = TRUE, color = \"gray30\", linewidth = 0.4) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"BITCOIN\" = \"#3182bd\", \"ETHEREUM\" = \"#e6550d\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Absolute Daily Return Category\",\n    y = \"Sentiment Score\",\n    title = \"Sentiment Distributions Across Return Categories\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 13)\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Removed 62 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_ydensity()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe violin plots show how sentiment is distributed on days with different sized price moves. For both coins, sentiment stays close to neutral when returns are very small or small. As returns grow into the medium and large categories, the range of sentiment values widens, meaning that larger price swings tend to produce both more positive and more negative reactions rather than shifting sentiment in a single direction. Ethereum shows a stronger increase in variation than Bitcoin, which aligns with its generally more reactive market behavior. This pattern is consistent with the scatterplot, which also shows that sentiment becomes more dispersed, rather than uniformly higher or lower, on high-movement days.",

The wider distribution of its returns reinforces this pattern, indicating that Ethereum reacts more strongly to shifts in sentiment and public attention. Bitcoin’s tighter distribution aligns with its steadier sentiment profile and smaller volatility spikes. Together, these results show that behavioral indicators map onto meaningful differences in market behavior across the two assets.",

    "text": "3.8 Do Sentiment and Search Interest Lead Market Movements?\nAfter comparing behavioral indicators across assets, the next question is whether shifts in sentiment or search interest tend to occur before changes in price.

For both coins, most points cluster near zero on both axes, meaning that typical sentiment changes do not correspond to large next day price moves. However, the smooth trends curve upward for each asset, suggesting that more positive sentiment is often followed by slightly higher next day returns. Ethereum shows a stronger upward curve and wider spread of returns, which fits its more reactive behavior seen earlier in the analysis.\nThese patterns suggest that shifts in sentiment can sometimes precede more active or positive price movement, especially for Ethereum, although the effect is modest and not predictive. This supports the broader finding that behavioral indicators relate differently to each asset, reinforcing that Ethereum responds more strongly to changes in online sentiment than Bitcoin.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_lag, aes(x = search_lag1, y = daily_return, color = coin)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.35) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ coin, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"BITCOIN\" = \"#3182bd\", \"ETHEREUM\" = \"#e6550d\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Search Interest (Previous Day)\",\n    y = \"Daily Return\",\n    title = \"Next-Day Returns vs Previous-Day Search Interest\"\n  ) +\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\")\n)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 12 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor both Bitcoin and Ethereum, most points lie close to zero on both axes, indicating that typical fluctuations in search activity do not correspond to large next day price changes. The trend lines are nearly flat for Bitcoin and only gently upward-sloping for Ethereum, suggesting that higher public attention sometimes precedes slightly more positive or more active trading in Ethereum but has little effect for Bitcoin, (one could even argue that since it is slighly downward sloping, higher public attention precedes slighly more negative or less active trading for Bitcoin).\nThese patterns show that search interest provides only a weak leading signal for next-day price movement, and that search interest is worse at mapping market activieity for these two coins in comparison to Sentiment.",
