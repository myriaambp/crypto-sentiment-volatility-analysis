    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project examines how behavioral factors such as sentiment and attention shape cryptocurrency market dynamics between October 2024 and October 2025, focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Motivated by my background in neuroscience and my interest in transitioning to finance, I am particularly drawn to understanding how patterns of human behavior manifest in financial data. Cryptocurrencies provide an ideal setting for this research because their prices are highly sensitive to collective mood and information flow, often reacting to changes in public sentiment and online search activity quite rapidly. The analysis centers on three questions: How daily sentiment fluctuations, whether optimistic or pessimistic, correlate with market volatility and returns, whether spikes in public attention, measured through Google search interest, precede or follow periods of heightened instability, and whether Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in how strongly they respond to these behavioral signals. Through these questions, the project aims to understand how behavioral and psychological dynamics influence financial market movements.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis project integrates three open data sources to examine how market activity, online sentiment, and public attention evolve for Bitcoin and Ethereum between December 2, 2024 and December 1, 2025. This one year window corresponds to the maximum period available under the free tiers of the APIs used in this project: both CoinGecko and Santiment restrict historical access to approximately the past 365 days unless a paid plan is used.\nDaily market data come from the CoinGecko Market Data API, which compiles cryptocurrency prices, trading volumes, and market capitalization across major global exchanges. Online sentiment is obtained from the Santiment API, which analyzes social media discussions and other text based signals to estimate the overall tone toward each asset. Public attention is measured using Google Trends, accessed through the gtrendsR package in R, which provides normalized daily search interest for the keywords “bitcoin” and “ethereum.”\nAPI requests require authentication, so all keys were stored privately in my .Renviron file. The data pull script automatically downloads the raw JSON responses, converts them into CSV files, and stores them in data/raw/. These raw files are then cleaned, standardized, and merged by coin and date. This includes aligning timestamps to a daily frequency, normalizing sentiment values, and handling a small number of missing days, primarily dates where Santiment did not report sentiment data, which is common due to API rate limits or gaps in social media coverage.\nThe final merged dataset contains one full year of daily observations for each coin and provides a reproducible foundation for exploring how market conditions, sentiment, and search behavior relate to cryptocurrency volatility.",
