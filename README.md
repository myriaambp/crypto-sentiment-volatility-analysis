# Crypto Sentiment & Volatility Analysis

This project examines the relationship between cryptocurrency market volatility and social sentiment indicators. Using time-series price data, Google Trends search interest, and sentiment metrics, the analysis explores how sentiment evolves around major market movements and whether it can help explain or anticipate periods of high volatility.

The accompanying Quarto website includes:

- Time-series visualizations of Bitcoin and Ethereum prices
- Sentiment indicators from search and social-media-based datasets
- Comparative analysis of sentiment shifts relative to price volatility
- Statistical summaries and key insights
- A rendered version of the full analysis hosted through GitHub Pages

This repository contains the code, data, and source files used to generate and publish the website.
